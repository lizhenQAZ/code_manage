<h1>Important notice</h1>

<p>On Sunday January 9th 2010, a gang of goths were
spotted stealing several garden gnomes from a shopping
center in downtown Milwaukee. They were all wearing green
jumpsuits and silly hats, and seemed to be having a whale
of a time. If anyone has any information about this
incident, please contact the police now.</p>
